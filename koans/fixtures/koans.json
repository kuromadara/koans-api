      "koan": " Kisan paid a visit to Ganto, who was living in quiet seclusion, and asked, \"Brother, are you getting two meals regularly?\" \"The fourth son of the Cho family supports me, and I am very much obliged to him,\" said Ganto. \"If you do not do your part well, you will be born as an ox in the next life and will have to repay him for what you owed him in this life,\" Kisan cautioned.\n Ganto put his fists on his forehead but said nothing. \"If you mean horns,\" Kisan said, \"you must stick out your fingers on top of your head.\" But before he finished speaking, Ganto shouted, \"Hey!\" Kisan did not understand his meaning and said, \"If you know something deeper, why don't you explain it to me?\" Ganto hissed at him and said, \"You have been studying Buddhism for thirty years, as I have, and you are still wandering around. I have nothing to do with you. Just get out.\" And with these words he shut the door in Kisan's face.\nThe fourth son of the Cho family happened to be passing by and, out of pity, took Kisan to his home. \"Thirty years ago we were close friends,\" Kisan said sorrowfully, \"but now he has attained something higher than I have and will not impart it to me.\"\nThat night Kisan could not sleep. He got up and went to Ganto's house. \"Brother,\" he implored, \"please be kind and preach the Dharma for me.\" Ganto opened the door and disclosed the teaching. The next morning Kisan returned home, happy with attainment. "

      "koan": " Emperor Wu of China was a very benevolent Buddhist. He built many temples and monasteries, educated many monks, and performed countless philanthropic deeds in the name of Buddhism. He asked the great teacher Bodhidharma, \"What merit is there in my good works?\" Bodhidharma replied, \"None whatsoever.\" The Emperor then asked, \"What is the Primal meaning of Holy Reality?\" Bodhidharma answered, \"Emptiness, not holiness.\" The Emperor then queried, \"Who, then, is this confronting me?\" \"I do not know,\" was Bodhidharma's reply. Since the Emperor did not understand, Bodhidharma left his kingdom.\nLater, the Emperor related this conversation to an adviser, Prince Shiko. Shiko reprimanded him, saying that Bodhidharma was a great teacher possessed of the highest truth. The Emperor, filled with regret, dispatched a messenger to entreat Bodhidharma to return. But Shiko warned, \"Even if all the people in the land went, that one will never return.\" "

She was seated in a place of highest honor, deep in meditation. Manjusri asked the Buddha how it was possible for a mere girl to attain a depth of mediation that even he could not attain. The Buddha said, \"Bring her out of meditation and ask her yourself.\"\nSo Manjusri walked around the girl three times [a gesture of reverence], then snapped his fingers. She remained deep in meditation. He then tried rousing her by invoking all his magic powers; he even transported her to a high heaven. All was to no avail, so deep was her concentration. But suddenly, up from below the earth sprang Momyo, an unenlightened one. He snapped his fingers once, and the girl came out of her meditation. "
